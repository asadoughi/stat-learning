Given:

Logistic regression: 20% training error rate, 30% test error rate
KNN(K=1): average error rate of 18%

For KNN with K=1, the training error rate is 0% because for any training
observation, its nearest neighbor will be the response itself. So, KNN has a
test error rate of 36%. I would choose logistic regression because of its lower
test error rate of 30%.
