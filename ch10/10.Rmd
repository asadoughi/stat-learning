### a
```{r}
set.seed(2)
x = matrix(rnorm(20*3*50, mean=0, sd=0.001), ncol=50)
x[1:20, 2] = 1
x[21:40, 1] = 2
x[21:40, 2] = 2
x[41:60, 1] = 1
```
The concept here is to separate the three classes amongst two dimensions.

### b
```{r 10b}
pca.out = prcomp(x)
summary(pca.out)
pca.out$x[,1:2]
plot(pca.out$x[,1:2], col=2:4, xlab="Z1", ylab="Z2", pch=19) 
```

### c
```{r}
km.out = kmeans(x, 3, nstart=20)
table(km.out$cluster, c(rep(1,20), rep(2,20), rep(3,20)))
```
Perfect match.

### d
```{r}
km.out = kmeans(x, 2, nstart=20)
km.out$cluster
```
All of one previous class absorbed into a single class.

### e
```{r}
km.out = kmeans(x, 4, nstart=20)
km.out$cluster
```
All of one previous cluster split into two clusters.

### f
```{r}
km.out = kmeans(pca.out$x[,1:2], 3, nstart=20)
table(km.out$cluster, c(rep(1,20), rep(2,20), rep(3,20)))
```
Perfect match, once again.

### g
```{r}
km.out = kmeans(scale(x), 3, nstart=20)
km.out$cluster
```
Poorer results than (b): the scaling of the observations affects the distance
between them.
